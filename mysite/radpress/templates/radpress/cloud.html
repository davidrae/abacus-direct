        <h1>Cloud Hosting</h1>
        <p>
            As Abacus is a web based application, it can be hosted on a 
            webserver anywhere in the world. This gives the client more options
            to explore when accessing data.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cloud hosted system may cheaper than a conventional on site 
            server. As eveything can be done in the cloud, the system can 
            enable businesses to enjoy minimal expenditure on hefty server 
            racks.
