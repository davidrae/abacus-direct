<h1>How does People Counting benefit railway stations?</h1>
<p>
One of the biggest changes at large railway stations is the new retail 
environment that has been created. With a mix of restaurants and shops, many 
stations have become a destination themselves, and not just somewhere to travel 
– see our Network Rail case study. Through its partners, Irisys has worked with 
railway companies to deliver key intelligence at stations, providing real 
business benefits.</p>

<h1>Maximise the value of your real estate</h1>

<p>
Data from Irisys people counting systems reveals just how many people visit  a 
station without accessing railway services. This, together with  identifying 
areas of high footfall, allows station owners to set rents that accurately 
reflect the value of the retail space available. You can also look at the 
investments you make in additional retail space and measure the corresponding 
footfall to these spaces, - giving you objective ROI figures.</p>

<h1>Build relationships with your retail partners</h1>

<p>
The information generated by Irisys people counting systems helps station
operators to pass on useful data to their retail partners, fostering stronger 
co-operation for mutual benefit. By helping your retail partners with setting 
and measuring KPIs such as customer conversion rates, you can increase their 
successes and by doing so increase the value of your retail space.

<h1>Get a consistent measure of passenger flows</h1>

<p>
graph-circle-borderDelivering real-time information on passenger numbers and 
ovement throughout the station, our people counting systems can give you 
detailed insight for planning staff deployment and scheduling, identifying and 
predicting passenger congestion, and where to place essential services such as 
passenger information and ticket sales. </p>

<h1>Assign staff deployment to demand</h1>

<p>
By measuring the usage of various facilities throughout the station, - like 
information points, ticket sales and washrooms, you can make sure that staff 
schedules accurately reflect the demand by passengers. By reducing the time your
 staff spend where they aren’t required and re-deploying them where they are, 
 you can make cost savings and create a better experience for passengers and 
 other visitors.</p>
