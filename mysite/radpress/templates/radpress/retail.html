    <p>
        Every day during opening hours, prospects visit your store, but leave without 
        having made a purchase. Customer “leakage” can potentially represent hundreds 
        of thousands or more lost sales opportunities. Conversion rate is the ratio 
        of the number of transactions and the number of visitors. It is considered 
        to be one of the most accurate indicators of retail performance. By constantly 
        monitoring the conversion rate, retailers get crucial information for improving profitability.

        The retail sector has never been more competitive, so it’s essential to 
        understand what’s behind every dip or hike in sales within your business.

                FootFall’s Site Analytics for Shopping Centres has been created 
                specifically for the retail property sector, to create greater 
                understanding of consumer behaviour and pinpoint where return 
                on investment is and isn’t being generated.

            We recognise that improving asset performance involves a lot more 
            than just footfall and tenant sales. In fact, our platform captures 
            all of your business data, giving you true insight into what is 
            affecting performance – such as footfall, sales, costs, staffing, 
            weather, marketing, car-parking and commercialization.

            Delivering real-time information on customer numbers and movement 
            throughout the store, Irisys People Counting systems can give you an
             accurate assessment of the footfall across your whole store network, 
             and show which stores are making the most of their opportunities.

            <h2>Assign staff deployment to demand</h2>
            <p>
                By measuring the footfall in your stores at different locations 
                and times of day, you can find the best places for in-store displays, 
                and make sure that staff schedules accurately reflect the demand 
                by customers.  By reducing the time your staff spend where they 
                aren’t required and re-deploying them where they are, you can 
                make cost savings and create a better experience for customers 
                and staff.
